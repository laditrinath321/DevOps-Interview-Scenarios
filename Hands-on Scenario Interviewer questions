2. **A team complains about high latency for an application hosted in AWS. How would you diagnose and reduce latency?**  
3. **You need to migrate an on-premises application to AWS using IaC. What tools would you use, and how?**  
4. **An AWS Lambda function is taking longer to execute than expected. How would you identify and resolve the issue?**  
5. **How would you ensure a highly available architecture for a cloud-based application?**  

---

### **Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Scenarios**
1. **You need to provision and configure an entire infrastructure on AWS. How would you use Terraform to accomplish this?**  
2. **How would you handle changes to infrastructure code in a collaborative environment using Terraform?**  
3. **Your Terraform state file is accidentally deleted. What steps would you take to recover or recreate it?**  
4. **How would you set up a multi-cloud deployment using Terraform?**  
5. **A configuration drift has occurred between your IaC definition and the deployed infrastructure. How would you detect and fix it?**  

---

### **Automation and Scripting Scenarios**
1. **You need to automate the creation of user accounts on a Linux server. How would you approach this task?**  
2. **A repetitive task, such as rotating logs, is consuming time. How would you automate it using a script?**  
3. **How would you write a script to monitor disk usage and alert if it exceeds a threshold?**  
4. **You need to parse logs and extract specific patterns. Which scripting tools would you use, and how?**  
5. **A new service needs to be added to multiple servers. How would you automate the deployment process?**  

---

### **Monitoring and Logging Scenarios**
1. **A service is experiencing high response times. How would you use monitoring tools to identify the bottleneck?**  
2. **You are tasked with setting up centralized logging for a multi-node application. What tools and approach would you use?**  
3. **A critical alert was missed due to monitoring misconfiguration. How would you resolve and prevent this in the future?**  
4. **How would you set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor a Kubernetes cluster?**  
5. **You need to implement end-to-end tracing for a distributed system. What tools would you use, and how?**  

---

### **Security Scenarios**
1. **A container image has vulnerabilities. How would you detect and fix them?**  
2. **You suspect credentials have been hardcoded into a repository. How would you locate and remediate this issue?**  
3. **How would you implement secrets management for a CI/CD pipeline?**  
4. **A production server has been compromised. What immediate actions would you take to mitigate the issue?**  
5. **How would you enforce compliance in your IaC or CI/CD workflows?**  

---

### **Collaboration and Teamwork Scenarios**
1. **A team member pushes code that breaks the build. How would you handle and prevent this issue in the future?**  
2. **How would you manage conflicts when multiple teams are working on the same codebase?**  
3. **Your team disagrees on the choice of a tool for a new project. How would you handle this situation?**  
4. **How would you onboard a new developer into a DevOps workflow?**  
5. **How would you ensure clear documentation and knowledge sharing for a new deployment process?**
